## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the CMU Blockchain Governance repository. We are currently working on DeFi governance for several protocols, and this repo will contain all you need to know to contribute/ what we are currently working on. Head over to the individual protocol folders for more specific information to each protocol, or the voting folder to see how our process works. 

## Contribute

We strongly believe in being open-source and transparent in the work we do. If you would like to make a proposal, we would love to hear what ideas you have and what you have to say. 

1. Join the discord.
2. Send a brief summary of the proposal you want to submit in the governance channel. 
3. We'll discuss it and come to consensus at the next governance meeting.  


If you would like to be a token delegate and be part of the decision making process, apply to be a member of the club first [here](https://cmublockchain.xyz/members).
